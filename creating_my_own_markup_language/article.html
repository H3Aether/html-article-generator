			<div class="article-title">Creating my own markup language and its intertpreter to generate custom blog articles.</div>
			<div class="date">July 22, 2022</div>
			<div class="text">This is the first article of my blog. I just finished writing all the html to display the articles the way that I want. But I’m also thinking about my future self, who will most likely not want to dive into the code a second time. That is why I decided to create a tool that will allow me to create webpages of articles, based on a simple txt file. This webpage has been generated this way.</div>
			<div class="title">Abstract</div>
			<div class="text">The goal here is to allow anyone to create an html template once, and use it again for different contents (here, to write articles). To do this, I will start by defining a very simple custom markup language, then write code to convert it into a webpage.</div>
			<div class="text">The task will be divided into 3 parts: first, writing an article in a txt file, then converting it into a json array using Python, and finally turning that array into the final html page using JavaScript. Indeed, JavaScript can read json files with ease (after all, JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation).</div>
			<div class="image"><img src="image_abstract.png">The 3 steps of the process</div>
			<div class="title">First step: The markup language</div>
			<div class="subtitle">Presentation</div>
			<div class="text">To create this language, I took inspiration from existing tools, mostly HTML and LaTeX. It is design to be simple to use, and has only few options, as all the visual elements like fonts, colours, or text alignment are handled by CSS later. The goal here is to be able to master it in a minute and start writing without worrying about the quality of the final result.</div>
			<div class="subtitle">Structure and tags used</div>
			<div class="text">The file starts with the title of the article, followed by the date. Then a series of tags can be used to organise the article. The most important ones are the #title and #subtitle tags. Writing #image adds an image from a custom source and its description. Writing text without a tag will simply display it as a paragraph.</div>
			<div class="text">Comments can be added by beginning the line with //. These will not be saved anywhere other than in the txt file.</div>
			<div class="text">Finally, the file must end with an #end tag. And there we have it! </div>
			<div class="subtitle">Example</div>
            <pre><code class="plaintext">
This is my article title
July 22, 2022

#title This a title

#subtitle This is a subtitle

Some content. Same paragraph content.
Other paragraph content.

#image path/to/image.png Here I describe the image I just added.

// A comment that will not figure in the json file and the html page

#end
            </code></pre>
			<div class="title">Second step: Converting to JSON</div>
			<div class="subtitle">Presentation</div>
			<div class="text">Now that the article has been written in a txt file, I will use a Python script to convert it to a JSON array. It will save the content written as well as its ‘class’ (title, subtitle, image, or text). The script will read the file line by line and add an element in the array and figure out the class according to the tag in the beginning.</div>
			<div class="subtitle">Code overview</div>
			<div class="text">The logic of the code is very simple. Here is how it works:</div>
            <pre><code class="plaintext">
Read the article title and date
While the current line is not '#end'
    Read the current line
    Add an element in the JSON array based on its content
    Skip to the next nonempty line
            </code></pre>
			<div class="text">The first function that we need will allow us to ignore the empty lines, by skipping to the next nonempty one (comments are considered empty lines).</div>
            <pre><code class="python">
def next_nonempty_line(lines, current_line_number):
    """
    list lines : the list of lines of the article
    int current_line_number : the current line number (starting from 0)
    """
    current_line_number += 1
    while current_line_number < len(lines) and ( lines[current_line_number] == '\n' or lines[current_line_number].startswith('//') ):
        current_line_number += 1
    return current_line_number
            </code></pre>
            <div class="text">Then, for each line that we find, we can create a dictionary corresponding to the content that we read. Luckily Python makes this very easy with the startswith() attribute. Here is an example with a #title line:</div>
            <pre><code class="python">
if article_lines[current_line_number].startswith('#title '): # if the current line is a title
    dict = { 'class'   : 'title',
            'content'  : article_lines[current_line_number][7:-1]}
            </code></pre>
            <div class="text">The #image tag is a bit trickier to deal with since it can be followed (or not) by two arguments. Here is how it is handled:</div>
            <pre><code class="python">
def extractImageInfos(line):
    i = line.find(' ') # find the first space, where the source begins
    j = line.find(' ', i+1) # find the second space, where the description begins
    if j != -1: # if there is a text description
        return { 'class'    : 'image',
                    'source'   : line[i+1:j],
                    'content'  : line[j+1:-1]}
    else: # if there is no text description, the content is empty
        return { 'class'    : 'image',
                    'source'   : line[i+1:-1],
                    'content'  : ''}
            </code></pre>
            <div class="text">The final step is to write the array in a JSON file and save it. The program can be used by running the following command : py article_txt_to_json_converter.py &lt;article_txt_file_name&gt;.</div>
			<div class="text">The complete code can be found on my GitHub.</div>
			<div class="title">Third step: Converting to HTML</div>
			<div class="subtitle">Presentation</div>
			<div class="text">Now that I can create a structured JSON file in seconds, I need to use it to generate an HTML webpage. I will naturally use JavaScript. The idea is to start with a nearly empty page and append &lt;div&gt; elements one after the other. The generated code can then be saved in a new file and used on the blog.</div>
			<div class="subtitle">Importing the JSON file</div>
			<div class="text">When I tried to make my program import a JSON file and read it, I hit an unexpected wall. One could think that a localhosted HTML page will have access to local files, but the request is blocked. What happens is that local files are now considered as foreign files, since a security threat has been discovered. I finally found an answer that does the job perfectly:</div>
            <pre><code class="js">
function getJsonFile(){
    var file_to_read = document.getElementById("jsonfileinput").files[0];
    var fileread = new FileReader();
    fileread.onload = function(e) {
        var content = e.target.result;
        var intern = JSON.parse(content); // parse json 

    const div_to_remove = document.getElementById("removeme"); // Removing the div that was used to import the json file
    div_to_remove.remove();
    document.title = intern[0].content; // Sets the title of the page to the title of the article

        intern.forEach(dict => { // Loop through the json file
        addElement(dict); // Display the content of the json file
        });
            };
    fileread.readAsText(file_to_read);
}
            </code></pre>
            <div class="text">Now we only need to define the function that will add a &lt;div&gt; in the HTML page. It is very straight forward and only changes its behaviour if an image is encountered.</div>
            <pre><code class="js">
function addElement(dict) {
    var newDiv = document.createElement("div"); // Create a new div element
    var newContent = document.createTextNode(dict.content); // Create a text node

    if (dict.class == "image") {
        var newImg = document.createElement("img"); // Create a new img element
        newImg.src = dict.source; // Set the source of the image
        newDiv.appendChild(newImg); // Append the image to the div
    }
    
    newDiv.appendChild(newContent); // Append the text to div
    newDiv.classList.add(dict.class); // Add the class to the div
    container.insertBefore(newDiv, footer); // Append div to the HTML document, in the container and before the footer
}
            </code></pre>
            <div class="text">That’s it for the code! Once again all of it is available on my GitHub.</div>
			<div class="title">Demonstration &amp; Improvements</div>
			<div class="subtitle">Demonstration</div>
			<div class="text">Let’s look at how to use this tool. First write your article and convert it to JSON by executing the following command in a terminal: py article_txt_to_json_converter.py &lt;article_txt_file_name&gt;.</div>
			<div class="image"><img src="image_terminal.png">Executing the command in a terminal.</div>
			<div class="text">Then open article_json_to_html_converter.html with your browser and select the newly generated JSON file. The page updates and displays the article!</div>
			<div class="image"><img src="image_html_converter.png"></div>
			<div class="image"><img src="image_html_result.png">The converter page and the result.</div>
			<div class="text">To save it, open the inspector with F12, copy the 'container' div, and paste it in the empty_article.html (line 40). Don't forget to change the title of the page (line 8). Then save it as new file.</div>
			<div class="image"><img src="image_copy_code.png">Copying the code : Inspector, Right click on &lt;div class="container"&gt; &gt; Copy &gt; Exterior of HTML.</div>
			<div class="text">And voilà! This file can be used for the blog. Nevertheless, make sure that the related CSS files are accessible.</div>
			<div class="text">To further modify it, you can use an online HTML formatter (like <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html" target=”_blank”>this one</a>) and add new elements.</div>
			<div class="subtitle">Possible improvements</div>
			<div class="text">I am generally satisfied of this tool and believe that it will save me a lot of time. However, it can only create about 90% of an article. You may have noticed that this article contains code snippets, and that the markup language does not handle them. I tried to implement it but couldn’t finish it, mainly because of the way that Python handles backslashes. Same thing for math formulas (that are not present here, but I plan to include some in the next articles).</div>
			<div class="text">As a result, I have to manually add these in the final html file, which is not difficult nor time consuming, but I would still like my language to handle them.</div>
			<div class="text">For the third time, all of this project is available on my GitHub. I hope you liked it. Feel free to use and modify it.</div>
